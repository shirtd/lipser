# lips

## TODO

color flag saves an additional file; no recompute.
redo contours.sample.Sample.get_levels
 - cut "type" could be an arg; _=a,b.., diff=(b-a)/2.., etc

## TODO FUTURE

 - decentralize ploting to avoid unnecessary loads
  - no plt in main
 - implement --rips --union vs. --cover --union
 - just hide edges
 - no need to re-write json for downsamples
 - sample and keep going; no need to reload before rendering
 - refactor as contours, topology and util different packages
